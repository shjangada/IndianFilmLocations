In this project, we have created an interactive world map that shows the global filming locations of Indian films. The map is colored based on the number of films shot in each country, and a user is able to click a country and see a preview of which films were shot there. 
We used the list of films that our classmates used for their individual projects, converting this into a CSV file and scraping IMDB to find the filming locations for each movie using Beautiful Soup(done in scrape.py). We then used Observable to create the map.
